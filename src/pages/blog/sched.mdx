# Sched App: Schedule-based Note Taking App for Students/Teachers

Schedule-based note taking app for students/teachers built using `Next.js`, `NextAuth`, `TypeScript`, `tRPC`, `Prisma` and `Railway`.

## Quick Story

A couple months ago, I joined a coding community which is called [Chingu Voyages](https://github.com/chingu-voyages), where we made a fun webdev project in a team. We made a schedule-based note taking app for students/teachers and I was in-charge of the backend dev and the CI/CD. The tech-stacks that we used were React, Express, TypeScript, MongoDB and Heroku (automate deployment via Github Actions).

Here's the source code for the group project: [REPO](https://lnkd.in/gYNhaV_N)

Since the timeline was short, and all of the team members were busy with their real work, we barely finish our MVP.

Then I decided to create a new solo project with the same concepts (schedule-based note taking app for students/teachers) but with my designs and tech-stacks preference. I couldn't believe how fast I can build this on my own!

## About the app

## Project Features

- User able to login via OAuth with `GitHub`, `Twitter`, `Twitch` and `Spotify` providers.
