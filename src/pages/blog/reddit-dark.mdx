# Reddit Client App: Reddit Dark

This is my first **Frontend project** that I did when I completed the first half of the Fullstack Engineering Course with Codecademy. This took me quite a long time to build as I am not really comfortable with using **Redux** and **React-Router** at that point.

## About the app

![reddit-dark](/blogs/reddit-dark.jpg)

**Reddit Dark** is a Frontend web application that displays the data fetched from **Reddit API**. It's exactly like Reddit, but with my styling and themes preference.

The goal of this project is to get familiar with displaying dynamic data (images, gifs, videos, contents) and dynamic routing with **React-Router**.

## Techstacks

I built this project using **React** framework/library and **JavaScript** language

## Packages

The packages that help me the most to build this project are **React-Router**, **Redux** and **Material-UI**.
