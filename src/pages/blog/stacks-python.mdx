Stacks is one of the data structures that a programmer needs to understand. In this article, I will explain how to code a basic stacks data structure with Python.

## Pre-requisite

In this article, you need to have a knowledge on **nodes** and **linked list** before proceeding.

## Concept

Imagine gym plates (weights) in a stack. To take out a plate, we can only take out the weight from the top of the stack. And to add a plate, we can only put the plate at the top of the stack.

In this context, stacks data structure is a **linked list** in a stack. We can only remove the head node in the stack, add node on top of the stack (on top of head node), and also peek the head node in the stack without removing it.

- **push** - Push/Add new node on top of head node in the stacks
- **pop** - Pop/Remove node at the head node in the stacks (second node will become the new head node, if there's any)
- **peek** - Peek the head node in the linked list

A less frequently used term for stacks is **First In, Last Out**, or **FILO**

## 1st Step: Node

First step we need to create **node** class:

```python
class Node:
  def __init__(self, value, next_node=None):
    self.value = value
    self.next_node = next_node

  def set_next_node(self, next_node):
    self.next_node = next_node

  def get_next_node(self):
    return self.next_node

  def get_value(self):
    return self.value
```

This is a basic **`node`** class, so I will not be explaining about this code, and focus more on explaining how to write stacks.

## 2nd Step: Initialising Stack Class

```python
class Stack:
  def __init__(self, limit=None):
    self.top_node = None
    self.size = 0
    self.limit = limit
```

Initiate a Stack class and define the constructor **`__init__`** method. Set **`self.top_item`** to None, **`self.size`** to 0 and **`self.limit`** to limit (default = None). The `self.top_node` will keep track of the top node in the stack, **`self.size`** is the current size of the stack, which will be 0 initially as when we initialized the Stack class, there will be no node yet in the stack. And **`self.limit`** is the limit size of the stack (which will be None by default).

## 3rd Step: peek, has_space and is_empty

Then write these codes under the same Stack class:

```python
def peek(self):
    if not self.is_empty():
      return self.top_item.get_value()
    print("Nothing to see here!")

def has_space(self):
    return self.limit > self.size

def is_empty(self):
    return self.size == 0
```

**peek** is to see the first node value if the queue is not empty.

**has_space** is to check if there's space left to be filled. If the limit is more that the current size, it will return **`True`**, or else, **`False`**.

**is_empty** is for checking if the queue is empty or not. if **`self_size`** is equal to 0, it will return **`True`**, and if it's not, **`False`**.

## 4th Step: Push

```python
def push(self, value):
    if self.has_space():
      new_node = Node(value)
      new_node.set_next_node(self.top_node)
      self.top_node = new_node
      self.size += 1
    else:
      print("fullstack!")
```

First we can write and if statement with **self.has_space()**. If there's space available then we can push a node in the stack.

**`item = Node(value)`** is to instantiate a Node with value passed as an argument (have to be in node) and assign it to **`new_node`** variable. Then we can use **`.set_next_node()`** to set the **`new_node`** to point to the current top node in the stack, **`self.top_node`**. And then, we can set the new top node to the **`new_node`** as it will become the new head node. Don't forget to increment the size by 1 as we have added a new node in the stack.

## 5th Step: Pop

```python
def pop(self):
    if not self.is_empty():
      node_to_remove = self.top_node
      self.top_node = node_to_remove.get_next_node()
      self.size -= 1
      return node_to_remove.get_value()
    print("Stack empty!")
```

To pop or remove the head node in the stack, first we have to make sure that the stack is not empty. Write an if statement with **`not self.is_empty()`**. If the stack is not empty, assign the top node in the stack to **`node_to_remove`** variable. Next, set the top node, **`self.top_node`** to become the second node in the stack, via **`.get_next_node()`**. Make sure to decrease the **`self.size`** by 1.
