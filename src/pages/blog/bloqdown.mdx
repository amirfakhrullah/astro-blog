# BloqDown: Markdown Forum/Blog Site

I've been wanting to try **tRPC** and **Prisma** for a while. Since I got some free time, I decided to create a simple project using those techs.

## Description

BloqDown is an open-source Simple Markdown Forum/Blog site using **Next.js**, **Next-Auth**, **TypeScript**, **Prisma**, **PlanetScale** and **tRPC**. The aim here is to learn how to properly use these techstacks.

- Live: [bloqdown.amfr.me](https://bloqdown.amfr.me)
- Source Code: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/amirfakhrullah/bloqdown)

## Goals

I know the UI for this project is not great. But that's not the goal for building this site. The goals for this project are:

- Creating fully typesafe APIs using **tRPC**

- Using **Prisma** as **TypeScript ORM**

- Setting up **PlanetScale** as **MySQL** db for the site

- Set cookie for anonymous users thru **Next.js** middleware

- Auth using **Next-Auth** (Github Provider)

- Render post content as markdown using **react-markdown**

## Features

- Users can perform any activity in the site as anonymous or as GitHub user (login via **Next-Auth**)

- Users can delete or edit own posts

- Users can only delete own comments

- Users can like any posts they want

- Can sort posts based on latest and popularity

- Tags Feature: Users allow to add tags to their own posts, and in homepage, they can filter posts by tags

## Techstacks

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
- [React-Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown)
- [Next-Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed using **`tRPC`** as it really helps me in inferring response types and and use them on the frontend. This is really efficient and really improves the developer experience as a **`TypeScript`** Developer.

Overall, this is a really fun build.
