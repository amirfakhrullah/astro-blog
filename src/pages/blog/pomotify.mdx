# Pomotify: Pomodoro with Spotify

Normally when I want to focus on something without any distraction, no matter if it's studying, or even just doing some work, I would use the Pomodoro technique to get me focus and zone-in

## About the app

![pomotify](/blogs/pomotify.JPG)

Pomotify is a simple **Fullstack** Pomodoro timer app with **Spotify integration**. As a Pomodoro technique user and Spotify lover, I would love to have this kind of application. With Spotify in the web, users can focus on their study/work while listening to some playlists without the need to open their Spotify app.

## Techstack used

For the client-side, I used **React**, **Styled-Components**, **Material-UI**, **Framer-Motion**.
For the server side, I used **Node** and **Express**. I also used **Spotify API** for the Spotify integration.

For the deployment, I used **Vercel**.

## Code Snippets

I used **Styled-Components** for styling. I like put all the themes in one file and just call it if I want to use it in any components. This can prevent repetitive codes (Always practice DRY - Dont Repeat Yourself).

Common themes: **theme.js**

```js
export const theme = {
  black: "#191414",
  green: "#1DB954",
  grey: "#262323",
  hoverGreen: "#117735",
  pitchBlack: "black",
  borderRadius: "12px",
  textColor: "#f4f4f4",
  textGrey: "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)",
  borderLine: "1px solid #1DB954",
};
```

I put all the common themes in a variable **theme** and then I will pass this themes as a prop into **ThemeProvider** that wraps the whole app (**index.js**). You can see the code below:

```jsx
import * as mainTheme from "./theme.js";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ThemeProvider theme={mainTheme.theme}>
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```
